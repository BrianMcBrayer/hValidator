hValidator
============

An Angular form validator for folks who have to use non-Angular forms. Initially designed to work with standard HTML5 forms and Telerik's Kendo UI.

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Validates standard HTML5 form elements in an intuitive way</li>
    <li>Live binding to input, textarea, and select controls</li>
    <li>Intuitive error reporting for invalid controls</li>
    <li>Validate all controls in a loop or individual controls by themselves</li>    
</ul>

<h2>But Kendo UI already has a validator!</h2>

I know, and it is a good one. However, it is lacking a lot of Angular niceties such as live updating when form controls are created or destroyed. I will add a table comparing the two in upcoming days.
